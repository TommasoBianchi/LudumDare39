# Ludum's Witch

Keeping alive an event like Ludum Dare is a difficult task.

There are jams every year and thousands of users. A lot of energy is required to keep Ludum Dare working and you don’t want her to run out of it, do you? For this reason, she recruited you to get the souls of your fellow programmers, artists and designers which she feeds on.

That’s right, you have to slay your way through the Ludum Dare community.

You impersonate a great, bearded and four-eyed man which must kill the goblins (which are the impersonations of your fellows, interesting choice) so that Ludum Dare can get the souls she needs. Ludum Dare is impersonated by a beautiful and hard-to-get witch, that helps you with a magic shield. However, keeping the shield activated consumes souls, so you may want to gather them fast. Beware, staying outside of the shield will lower your health because of the toxicity of the dungeon (goblins pollute their environment too). Goblins can’t go through the shield, so you may want to fight them from inside of it and to go outside just to explorate the dungeon. Throughout the dungeon, you may find some ruins which have powerups for you. You can take them by dragging and dropping them on the two slots in the lower part of the screen. Be careful with powerups, since they consume souls each time you activate them. The witch will stay still unless you tell her to follow you.
